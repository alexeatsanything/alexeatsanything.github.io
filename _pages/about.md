Hey I'm Alex. I'm planning to graduate from Amherst College in 2025 with a B.A. in Neuroscience. I like cooking, eating, films, and hiking. Find me on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/xxtracheetoluvr/)!

I'm interested in biochemical and cellular methods for treating genetic diseases. I've worked in Professor Krzysztof Palczewski's lab at [UC Irvine](https://ctvr.uci.edu) on genome editing in the eye and in Professor Sally Kim's lab at Amherst on actin dynamics in the synpase. I have joined Dr. Jingjing Gao's lab at UMass to work on lipid nanoparticle delivery to brain tissue.
