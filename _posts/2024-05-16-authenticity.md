"You have to try this Chinese place, it's so authentic!"
  
"Authenticity" has no meaning when it comes to describing food.
Some people may try to rephrase "authentic food" to "traditional food" but this description is also meaningless.
Most people who use these words are gatekeepers, thinking it is their obligation to defend a certain type of cuisine from outside attack or appropriation.
This disorientation often leads to thinking of cuisine as a sort of code of ethics that must not be violated, and the only reason for thinking this way must be due to some kind of egotistical perversion.
Adherence to orthodoxy only leads to the propagation of the banality of life.
These same people often tout the utility of food as a means of communication between people and a vehicle for delivering knowledge of different cultures.
But how does puritanism allow one to keep an open mind?  

I am saddened by those who devalue cuisine that they don't deem "real." Personally, I love Panda Express. I love that there is food out there that is different than the food I am used to. In fact, the more dissimilar, the better. 
Eating and cooking are some of the most stimulating ways to practice one's aesthetic activity. It is a direct way for human beings to understand themselves and Nature. 
It is an advanced level of communication within one's heart, solely personal. Self-reflexive people savor their personal experiences, and after reliving their life experience over and over in their hearts, it can emerge as a performance that reconstructs the beauty and Nature around the self. 
This is the essence of food. Those that ascribe cuisine some superficial qualities such as "authenticity" are superannuated and unable to utilize the full potential for aesthetic judgement. Acknowledging food as anything other than a wholehearted appreciation of the self and Nature is an imitation of the full human experience. Thus, to understand what it means to eat, it is essential for people to practice their reflexive aesthetic practice and cultivate artistic capabilities.
