Deciding on a restaurant in K Town with a group of friends that include a vegetarian and a seafood allergic is challenging to say the least. Eventually we landed at Hangari Kalguksu in the strip mall across the street from the K Town Hmart. We waited in a short line and were led to our table after placing our order.
As the name would imply, Hangari Kalguksu specializes in _kalguksu_, or knife-cut noodles. The menu reflects this, with different types of kalguksu taking up the majority of the offerings. Some non-kalguksu items include their acclaimed _bossam_, pork belly, or the _bibimmyeon_, cold noodles (which are also vegetarian).

We arrived at our table stacked high with a variety of banchan, including cabbage and radish kimchi, _ssam-mu_ (pickled radish paper), _bori bap_ (barley rice), and _ssamjang_ (sauce for the bossam).
Though the kimchi was a bit underseasoned for me, they did provide a bit of a funky bite that led to a little satisfaction.

    Hangari Bossam Large [74.99]
</div>

We got the large bossam to share around the table, and while the cabbage was pickled exceptionally well, the rest of the components were your typical easygoing fare at an atypical price. Nonetheless, this dish was the highlight of the night even when it pales in comparison to its peers in a similar price bracket.

    Seafood Kalguksu [22.99]

Next up I got the seafood kalguksu, which features knife-cut flour noodles floating in a spicy anchovy broth along with a variety of shellfish. The noodle themselves were very tender, springy, and quite flavorful when drenched in the oceanic soup.
The shellfish, however, was pretty overcooked and sparse when compared to the quantity of noodles.

Overall, I would give Hangari Kalguksu <a href="/blog/2024/rating/">79 points.</a>
