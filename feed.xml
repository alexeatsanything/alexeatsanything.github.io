I love that there is food out there that is different than the food I am used to. In fact, the more dissimilar, the better. Eating and cooking are some of the most stimulating ways to practice one’s aesthetic activity. It is a direct way for human beings to understand themselves and Nature. It is an advanced level of communication within one’s heart, solely personal. Self-reflexive people savor their personal experiences, and after reliving their life experience over and over in their hearts, it can emerge as a performance that reconstructs the beauty and Nature around the self. This is the essence of food. Those that ascribe cuisine some superficial qualities such as “authenticity” are superannuated and unable to utilize the full potential for aesthetic judgement. Acknowledging food as anything other than a wholehearted appreciation of the self and Nature is an imitation of the full human experience. Thus, to understand what it means to eat, it is essential for people to practice their reflexive aesthetic practice and cultivate artistic capabilities.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Restaurants"/><category term="Misc"/><category term="food"/><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“You have to try this Chinese place, it’s so authentic!” “Authenticity” has no meaning when it comes to describing food.

However, Can Roca is not meant to be experienced as an intellectual exercise. Instead, their cuisine involves us in a spiritual interrogation of the ultimate inquiries surrounding human nature. In essence, its dishes can be considered artistic experimentation in which the Roca brothers take themselves and their history as the subject. In an amuse-bouche sequence, a bonsai olive tree is hoisted onto your table, bearing golden spheres of olive ice cream. It is easy to see this dish as an exemplary metaphor for the modernist apparatus governing the Roca kitchen; a tree bearing this bohemian fruit must receive nourishment from a soil carrying centuries of history.</p> <p>This is what separates Can Roca from their contemporaries (especially in the U.S.) that attempt to serve globalist cuisine. Unlike these self-absorbed establishments, Can Roca’s creativity starts at the humanly impulse for life, in which one’s rebellious nature compels one to sort out and deconstruct their inherently disordered experiences and capture something that was previously nonexistent. Artists of this nature contemplate the past, but only for so long as to understand the spiritual memories of primitive humans, never to experience them, which saves them the energy to stabilize their emotional state into a structured reconstruction of nature.</p> <p>One who experiences the final stage of this work at Can Roca may gaze upon it for some time, then let the flavors and smells diffuse through them. At a certain moment, their aesthetic impulses may trigger a transcendental emotional experience, in which the narrative landscape of nature, emotion, produce, and the fraternal relationship of the three brothers are revealed in its special construction. This ephemeral speech communicates with one’s heart and memories, introspectively reconstructing nature within one’s soul. In this way, El Celler de Can Roca’s technoemotional cuisine brings us closer to what makes us human: the impulse to be free, constructive, and one with nature.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Restaurants"/><category term="tasting-menu"/><category term="spain"/><category term="catalan"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Date of visit: March 22, 2024]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reading List</title><link href="https://alexyan.github.io/blog/2024/reading/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reading List"/><published>2024-05-14T03:37:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T03:37:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alexyan.github.io/blog/2024/reading</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alexyan.github.io/blog/2024/reading/"><![CDATA[<ul> <h6><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60528571-a-mountain-to-the-north-a-lake-to-the-south-paths-to-the-west-a-river"><em>A Mountain to the North, a Lake to the South, Paths to the West, a River to the East</em> </a>by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Krasznahorkai</h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25245995"><em>&#x2022; Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens</em></a> by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Krasznahorkai </h6> <h6> <a href="https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/nocilla-trilogy"><em>&#x2022; Nocilla Trilogy</em></a> by Agust&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez Mallo </h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/899068"><em>&#x2022; Playing For Thrills</em></a> by Wang Shuo </h6> <h6> <a href="https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/melancholy-i-ii"><em>&#x2022; Melancholia I &amp; II</em></a> by Jon Fosse </h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29633846"><em>&#x2022; Frontier</em></a> by Can Xue </h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/9998"><em>&#x2022; The Woman in the Dunes</em></a> by K&#333;b&#333; Abe </h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27220367-marrow"><em>&#x2022; Marrow</em></a> by Yan Lianke </h6> <h6> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472276.The_Republic_of_Wine"><em>&#x2022; The Republic of Wine</em></a> by Mo Yan </h6> <h6> &#x2022; &#36235;&#20809;&#36816;&#21160;&#183;&#22238;&#28335;&#31461;&#24180;&#30340;&#31934;&#31070;&#22270;&#26223; by Can Xue </h6> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Misc"/><category term="reading"/><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things I will try to read eventually]]></summary></entry></feed>
